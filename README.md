# Michaelis Menten (Km) Predictions for Enzyme-Substrate Pairs of Wild-type Enzymes

Internship project at the Institute of Computational Cell Biology - Heinrich Heine University, DÃ¼sseldorf. 



This repository contains scripts and notebooks for predicting the Michaelis constant (Km) of enzyme-substrate pairs by combining enzyme sequence embeddings with substrate molecular embeddings.
